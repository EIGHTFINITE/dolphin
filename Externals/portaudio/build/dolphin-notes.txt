This directory contains the Visual Studio project files which are used to build portaudio.
* portaudio's files were very old and messy
* Makes it easier to update portaudio in the future
* Uses dolphin's VSProps, so we know it's properly compatible

See full portaudio distribution for instructions about building and using portaudio.
