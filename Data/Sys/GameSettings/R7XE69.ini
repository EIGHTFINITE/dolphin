# R7XE69 - Need for Speed: Nitro

[OnFrame]
# Changes an idle loop that Dolphin is unable to detect, to one that it can detect.
#
# The loop waits for a vblank interrupt, spamming `OSYieldThread` in the meantime.
# The patch replaces the call to `VIWaitForRetrace`, which still executes the other threads,
# but sleeps instead of spinlocking when there is no thread to execute.
