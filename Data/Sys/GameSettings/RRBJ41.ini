# RRBJ41 - Rayman Raving Rabbids

[OnFrame]
# The game's idle loop is composed of two parts that alternate by branching to each other.
# The first part checks how much time has passed (through a function): if it's too much, it aborts the frame. This apparently never happens.
# The second part is a traditional "wait for the VIPostCallback interrupt to change a value".
# The patch changes a branch so that only the second part is executed, so that Dolphin can properly detect the idle loop.
