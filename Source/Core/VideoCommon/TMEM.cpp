//
// TMEM emulation tracks which textures should be cached in TMEM on a real console.
// There are two good reasons to do this:
//
// 1. Some games deliberately avoid invalidating a texture, overwrite it with an EFB copy,
//    and then expect the original texture to still be found in TMEM for another draw call.
//    Spyro: A Hero's Tail is known for using such overwritten textures.
//    However, other games like:
//      * Sonic Riders
//      * Metal Arms: Glitch in the System
//      * Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee
//      * NHL Slapshot
//      * Tak and the Power of Juju
//      * Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian
//      * 428: FÅ«sa Sareta Shibuya de
//    are known to (accidentally or deliberately) avoid invalidating and then expect the pattern
//    of the draw and the fact that the whole texture doesn't fit in TMEM to self-invalidate the
//    texture. These are usually full-screen efb copies.
//    So we must track the size of the textures as an heuristic to see if they will self-invalidate
//    or not.
//
// 2. It actually improves Dolphin's performance in safer texture hashing modes, by reducing the
//    amount of times a texture needs to be hashed when reused in subsequent draws.
//
// As a side-effect, TMEM emulation also tracks if the texture unit configuration has changed at
// all, which Dolphin's TextureCache takes advantage of.
//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// Checking if a texture fits in TMEM or not is complicated by the fact that Flipper's TMEM is quite
// configurable.
// Each of the eight texture units has two banks (even and odd) that can be pointed at any offset
// and set to any size. It is completely valid to have overlapping banks, and performance can be
// improved by overlapping the caches of texture units that are drawing the same textures.
//
// For trilinear textures, the even/odd banks contain the even/odd LODs of the texture. TMEM has two
// banks of 512KB each, covering the upper and lower halves of TMEM's address space. The two banks
// be accessed simultaneously, allowing a trilinear texture sample to be completed at the same cost
// as a bilinear sample, assuming the even and odd banks are mapped onto different banks.
//
// 32bit textures are actually stored as two 16bit textures in separate banks, allowing a bilinear
// sample of a 32bit texture at the same cost as a 16bit bilinear/trilinear sample. A trilinear
// sample of a 32bit texture costs more.
//
// TODO: I'm not sure if it's valid for a texture unit's even and odd banks to overlap. There might
//       actually be a hard requirement for even and odd banks to live in different banks of TMEM.
//
// Note: This is still very much a heuristic.
//       Actually knowing if a texture is partially or fully cached within TMEM would require
//       extensive software rasterization, or sampler feedback from a hardware backend.
