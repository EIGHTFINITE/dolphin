; This test tries to figure out a couple of unknown opcodes.

// 0x02ca is an unknown opcode found in Zelda ucodes.

// 0x02ca logically shifts (not rotates) the whole ACC0 right by signed 16-bit value AC1.M
// (So, if AC1.M is negative, it shifts left).
// We'll call it  lsrn, no arguments.
// 0x02cb is the same opcode, but arithmetic.
// We'll call it  asrn, no arguments.
